## Description of African Wildlife Classification

The African wildlife classification model describes the wildlife categories by organizing  the diverse animal species found across the African continent. 

These models can be categories based on the following:

Taxonomy: The traditional scientific classification using a hierarchical system (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).
Ecology: Grouping animals based on their habitat (e.g., savanna, forest, desert) and ecological roles.
Conservation Status: Categorizing species according to their risk of extinction (e.g., vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered) which is assessed by wildlife conservation department.

Human Interest: Informal classifications like the "Big Five" (lion, leopard, rhino, elephant, buffalo), initially used by hunters but now popular in tourism.
Computer Vision: In recent years, machine learning models are being developed to automatically classify and identify African wildlife from images and videos for conservation and research purposes 






# Special Instruction for a Wildlife Classification Model Code

The provided `create_resnet` function defines a ResNet50V2-based deep learning model for classifying African wildlife. Below are the special instructions for using and modifying this model:

1. **Input Shape**: Ensure that the `input_shape` parameter matches the dimensions of your input images (e.g., `(224, 224, 3)` for RGB images).

2. **Pre-trained Weights**: The model uses pre-trained weights from ImageNet. This helps in transfer learning, allowing the model to leverage features learned from a large dataset.

3. **Freezing Weights**: The base ResNet50V2 model's weights are frozen (`base_model.trainable = False`) to prevent them from being updated during training. If fine-tuning is required, set `base_model.trainable = True` and retrain with a lower learning rate.

4. **Model Architecture**:
   - The base ResNet50V2 model is followed by a `GlobalAveragePooling2D` layer to reduce the spatial dimensions.
   - A dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation is added for feature extraction.
   - The final dense layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class. Ensure that `len(classnames)` matches the number of wildlife categories.

5. **Class Names**: Define the `classnames` variable as a list of all wildlife categories (e.g., `classnames = ['lion', 'elephant', 'zebra', ...]`).

6. **Training**: Use a suitable optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., `categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class classification). Ensure your dataset is preprocessed and augmented as needed.

7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on a validation/test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

8. **Deployment**: Once trained, the model can be used for real-time classification of African wildlife from images or videos.

By following these instructions, you can effectively use and adapt the `create_resnet` function for African wildlife classification tasks.
